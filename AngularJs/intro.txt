AngularJS redefines how to build front-end applications. Instead of being afraid to cross the boundary between HTML and JavaScript, it takes it head-on.

Application frameworks, like Backbone, EmberJS, and others, require developers to extend from JavaScript objects that are specific to their frameworks. Although this approach has its merits, it unnecessarily pollutes your object space and requires you to have intimate knowledge of abstract objects that exist in memory. But we accept it because the web wasn’t originally designed to be as interactive as we expect it to be today, and we need frameworks to help us close the gap between JavaScript and HTML.

AngularJS closes that gap.

Instead of manipulating the DOM “directly,” you annotate your DOM with metadata (directives), and Angular manipulates the DOM for you.

AngularJS also does not depend on (or exclude the use of) any other framework. You can even build AngularJS apps in non-AngularJS frameworks.

It just works.

Sound awesome? It is. In this 7-part series we’re going to walk you through how to get started writing serious apps with AngularJS - even if you’ve never touched it before.

Follow along on this journey, and we’ll teach you how to become an expert AngularJS developer.

First things first: When should you use AngularJS?

AngularJS is an MV* framework that is ideal for use when building client-side single-page apps. It is not a library, but a framework for building dynamic web pages. It focuses on extending HTML and providing dynamic data binding, and it plays well with other frameworks (e.g., jQuery).

If you are building a single-page app, AngularJS will be perfect for you. Gmail, Google Docs, Twitter, and Facebook all fit into the AngularJS sweet spot. Game development and other apps that heavily manipulate the DOM or need pure speed are not good fits for AngularJS.
